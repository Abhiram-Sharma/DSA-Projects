1. The Snake Game (Arrays) : 
   A project that involves implementing a game of Snake using Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
   to ensure efficient and optimized gameplay. Designing the game board, implementing the mechanics 
   of the game, and using DSA to manage the movement and behavior of the snake and the food items.

2. Cash Flow Minimizer (Graphs/ Multisets/Heaps) : 
   This project tackles debt settlement within a group. We model financial obligations as a graph and aim to minimize transactions needed to clear all debts.
   Utilizing graphs, multisets, and heaps, the project identifies debtors and creditors efficiently. By strategically pairing them, it minimizes transactions required for a debt-free state. This offers a solution for group expenses, peer-to-peer loans, or even optimizing financial processes within organizations.

3. Sudoku Solver (Backtracking) :
   This project tackles the classic Sudoku puzzle using backtracking. By systematically trying different values in each cell, it eliminates invalid placements and finds a solution that adheres to Sudoku's rules. This project serves as a gateway to understanding backtracking, a powerful algorithm used to solve problems with constraints, like scheduling or resource allocation.

5. File Zipper (Greedy Huffman Encoder) : 
   This project builds a file compressor using the Huffman coding algorithm. By analyzing character frequency, Huffman assigns shorter codes to frequently used characters, reducing file size. This project lets you explore the greedy approach and the trade-off between compression efficiency (file size) and speed (compression/decompression time).

6. Map Navigator (Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm) : 
   This project builds a navigation system using Dijkstra's algorithm. This powerful tool finds the shortest path between two points on a map, considering factors like distance and potential traffic congestion. By analyzing a network of roads and intersections, the Map Navigator guides you efficiently to your destination.
